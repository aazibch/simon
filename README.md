# Simon

The application creates a series of tones and lights and requires the user to repeat the sequence. If the user succeeds, the sequence gets progressively longer. If they fail and the strict mode is enabled, the game is over and the user would have to start over. However, if the strict mode is disable, the user's progress is not lost and they can try again.

## Demo
